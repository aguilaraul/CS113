How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change 
depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

Not often, and doesn't change depending on solution set because alogrithm
is still chooisng randomly and possibly checking previous solutions that 
were wrong.


What is good or bad about this strategy?

The best case for this strategy is to randomly guess the right answers on
first try. Or as per the requirement for the assignment, a good senario
would be less than 20 tries.

The worst case for this strategy is getting a solution after nearly
infinite attempts because previous attempts that were wrong could be 
selected to try again. This is a bad strategy becuase the algorithm 
randomly chooses option and it does not track previous attempts nor operate
in an organized fashion.
